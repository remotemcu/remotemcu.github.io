 * Chrome renders extra-wide &nbsp; characters for the Hoefler Text font.
 * This results in a jumping cursor when typing in both the Classic and block
 * editors. The following font-face override fixes the issue by manually inserting
 * a custom font that includes just a Hoefler Text space replacement for that
 * character instead.
